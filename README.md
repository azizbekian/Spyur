# Materialized Spyur app

"Spyur" is an information company that is collecting, processing and disseminating information about companies and organizations of Armenia.

The app is a materialized version of the [original Spyur app]. The service has not API whatsoever, so the data fetching is being done via parsing html (therefore, speed suffers).

As long as I cannot own the content being shown in the app, I am not allowed to post it in Google Play.
